<h3>Why Villiers</h3>
<p>Why Iâ€™m Here</p>
</br>
<p>I am hoping that this course will teach me how to methodically solve problems.</p>
<p>I hope to become confident in new programming languages and I am excited about the visit to Bletchley Park.</p>
<p>Also this counts as a D of E residential.</p>
</br>
<p>I look forward to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Learning more about unknown programming languages</li>
  <li>The food</li>
</ul>
